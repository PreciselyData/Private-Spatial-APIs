# Precisely Private Spatial APIs Setup on Local Docker Desktop

The Private Spatial APIs can be setup locally for test purpose.

## Step 1: Download Reference Data and Required Docker Images

The docker files can be downloaded from either Precisely's Data Portfolio or [Data Integrity Suite](https://cloud.precisely.com/). For information about Precisely's Data Portfolio,
see the [Precisely Data Guide](https://dataguide.precisely.com/) where you can also sign up for a free account and
access software, reference data and docker files available in [Precisely Data Experience](https://data.precisely.com/).

After download, the docker images need to be pushed to a container registry. If you don't have a container registry, you can create one for testing as shown below:
   ```
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2.7
   ```
Then you can use a script [push-images](../scripts/aks/push-images.sh) to push the docker images to container registry.
> Note: Unzip the downloaded docker images to a directory <spatial_analytics_docker_images_dir> so that it contains tar files.

Open a shell on you local system and execute the following steps.
Run the shell script to push images to Azure Container Registry:
```shell
cd <spatial_analytics_docker_images_dir>
chmod a+x ~/Private-Spatial-APIs/scripts/aks/push-images.sh
~/Private-Spatial-APIs/scripts/aks/push-images.sh <container_registry_url>
```
You can also load images one by one if there's no enough disk space available.
There are six docker images which will be pushed to container registry:
1. feature-service
2. mapping-service
3. tiling-service
4. namedresource-service
5. spatialmanager-service
6. samples-data

Upload images one by one:
```shell
~/Private-Spatial-APIs/scripts/aks/push-images.sh <container_registry_url>  <tar file name without ext>
```


## Step 2: Running Service Locally

1. **Configure environment file**

   While building docker image locally, configure environment file to reference local image registry. Update _.env_ file in
      `docker-compose` folder with environment variable referencing image registry.
   ```properties
   IMAGE_REGISTRY=<container_registry_url>
   ```

   If customizing the copy sample data location on the system, please provide your desired path for the `SPATIAL_PATH` variable in the .env file. Otherwise, it will default to the path specified in the .env file.

2. **service to start using docker compose file**

   If you *always* want all the service to start you can run:
   ```
   docker compose up
   ```
3. **Cleanup of local services**

   Regardless of any above method of running the services locally below cleanup command will be same.

   ```shell
   docker compose down
   ```
