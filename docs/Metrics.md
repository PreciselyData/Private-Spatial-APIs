# Configurations for Metrics

## Generating Insights from Metrics

The Private-Spatial-APIs application microservices expose metrics which can be used for monitoring and troubleshooting the
performance and behavior of the Private-Spatial-APIs application.

Depending on your alerting setup, you can set up alerts based on these metrics to proactively respond to the issues in
your application.

### Exposed Metrics
