## Utilities

### [Tile Generator](https://help.cloud.precisely.com/r/Precisely-Data-Integrity-Suite/Latest/en-US/Spatial-Cloud-Native-Guide/Utilities/Tile-Generator)
The Tile Generator is a command-line utility, named cache_builder.bat on Windows and cache_builder.sh on Linux, that generates MapTiling requests to send to a MapTiling service or to save to a file. Saving a request to a file is useful for seeding the tile cache in batch or for generating tiles offline.

### [WMTS Tile Generator](https://help.cloud.precisely.com/r/Precisely-Data-Integrity-Suite/Latest/en-US/Spatial-Cloud-Native-Guide/Utilities/WMTS-Tile-Generator)
OGC-compliant Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) built to the OGC specifications for WMTS versions 1.0.0 (located at http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts).

The WMTS Tile Generator is a command-line utility, named tile_builder.bat on Windows and tile_builder.sh on Linux, that executes batch runs to generate map tiles for the WMTS service and optionally seed the WMTS tile cache.

### [Map Uploader](https://help.cloud.precisely.com/r/Precisely-Data-Integrity-Suite/Latest/en-US/Spatial-Cloud-Native-Guide/Utilities/Map-Uploader)
Map Uploader is a tool that copies the properties of the layers in a MapInfo Pro map to a Spectrum Spatial server. It takes the information of one map stored in MapInfo Pro and stores the equivalent information in a set of named resources on the server.

### [CLI](https://help.cloud.precisely.com/r/Precisely-Data-Integrity-Suite/Latest/en-US/Spatial-Cloud-Native-Guide/Utilities/Spatial-CLI-Utility)
The Spatial CLI Utility provides command line access to connect with Spatial cloud server, export named resources (such as named tables) to your local file system or import them from a local file system to your Spatial cloud server. You can also use it interactively.
