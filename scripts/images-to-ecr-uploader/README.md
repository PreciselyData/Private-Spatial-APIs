Afterward, you can easily load these Docker images into your Docker environment.

Additionally, this repository includes a script that facilitates the download of Docker image zips from PDX and their
subsequent upload to AWS ECR.

Please note that this project assumes the presence of Python, Docker, and awscli on your system.

## Step 1 - Install Requirements

Run the following command to install requirements:

```console

## Step 2: Run Script for Uploading to ECR

> [!NOTE]:
> You need to have docker running locally for this script to work.
